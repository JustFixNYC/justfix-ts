# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0 (2021-06-25)

Added a `--dev` option to the CLI, which makes it easier to support offline development use cases.

When enabled, the CLI will no longer crash if a network error occurs: instead, it will either output empty common strings data, or it will keep the existing common strings data file if one already exists.

## 0.0.2 (2021-06-24)

Weird republish because Lerna is being dumb.

## 0.0.1 (2021-06-24)

Initial release.
