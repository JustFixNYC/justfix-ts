This package provides the base functionality for building autocomplete
interfaces powered by the [NYC Planning Labs GeoSearch API][geosearch].

For an example of this package in use, see the [manual test][] code.

If you don't have a transpiler or module bundler, a CommonJS version
of this package can be found under `commonjs`.
